
a) Write a update, delete trigger on clientmstr table. The System should keep track of the records that 
ARE BEING updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted records should be added in audit_trade table. 
(separate implementation using both row and statement triggers).

 create table client_master( id integer primary key not null,data integer);

insert into client_master values(1,1500);

insert into client_master values(2,1000);

insert into client_master values(3,2000);

insert into client_master values(4,2055);

delimiter //
create trigger after_delete
after delete on client_master
for each row
begin
insert into audit_table
set action='DELETE',
id=old.id,
data=old.data;
end
