Write a database trigger on Library table.
The System should keep track of the records that are being updated or deleted. The old value of updated 
or deleted records should be added in Library_Audit table.

CREATE TABLE LIB_AUDIT(RNO INT, 
    B_TITLE VARCHAR(20),     ACTION VARCHAR(20));
  
  CREATE TABLE BOOKS(RNO INT,     B_TITLE VARCHAR(20)); 

CREATE TABLE LIB_AUDIT(RNO INT, 
    B_TITLE VARCHAR(20), 
    ACTION VARCHAR(20)); 

CREATE TRIGGER before_book_delete 
    AFTER DELETE     ON books 
    FOR EACH ROW 
    BEGIN 
    INSERT INTO LIB_AUDIT 
    SET action ='DELETE', 
    RNO=OLD.RNO, 
    B_TITLE=OLD.B_TITLE; 
    END; 

DELETE FROM BOOKS WHERE RNO = 1; 

CREATE TRIGGER before_book_update 
    BEFORE UPDATE 
    ON BOOKS 
    FOR EACH ROW 
    BEGIN 
    INSERT INTO LIB_AUDIT 
    SET action ='UPDATE', 
    RNO=NEW.RNO, 
    B_TITLE=NEW.B_TITLE; 
    END; 

UPDATE BOOKS SET B_TITLE = 'XYZ' WHERE RNO = 2;
